Design Implementation
===
I chose to implement a design that looked into mutual top trade flows. My design still uses countries as nodes and lines as links between top trade partners. However, instead of having a link from every country to all of their top ten trade partners there are only lines between countries who are both one of each others top ten trade partners. I chose to group the countries together by continents in circles so the viewer can easily see how much of the top trade is within continents and how much is between continents. Another goal I had with this visualization was to make it easy to see which country was exporting more to the other country between links. To do this I made the line turn green when the country you are hovering over exports more than it imports from the country it is linked too. I also made the text of the country linked to the node you are hovering over turn red if it imports more than it exports and green if it exports more than it imports.

The general public, policy makes, and advocacy groups could be interested in this visualization. Policy makers could see if countries within trade agreements are also top 10 exporters.

Color could be helpful in this visualization. Very easy to identify gains and losses with red and green. Size could potentialy be helpful also to see how big the gain or loss was.

We decided that the most important thing in these designs was being able to quickly see which mutual trades resulted in a gain or loss for the country. Although making the size of the nodes larger depending on the total gain or loss it could be confusing about what the size actually represents so the second design could be the better of the two.
