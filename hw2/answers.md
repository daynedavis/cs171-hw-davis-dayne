###Question 0.1
The horizontal and vertival positions of the nodes can signify what category the node is in. It can also be used to group the nodes by putting nodes with similar traits in similar positions. Datasets that have connections between objects would be good to represent this way. Like friendships or social network data.

###Question 0.2
You could use shape, orientation, texture, luminance, and saturation.

###Question 0.3
They are not all independent. Luminance and color could depend on each other and so could shape and orientation.


###Question 1.1
Relative positioning can be good to show the difference between values of certain nodes but when many of the values are similar it can cause them to be on top of each other which may not look nice. Absolute positioning can be neater but does not give as much insight about the data.

###Question 1.2
Quantitative data is better for scatter plots such as the population and gdp of the countries. Ordinal data is not as good such as the names of the countries in alphabetical order because you do not get much insight from them.

###Question 2.1
Using d3 layouts makes it very easy to organize your data and enables you to use the many features that comes with it.

###Question 3.1
You could group the nodes in a way that reduces the overlapping of the lines. You could add in filters that only shows the lines of certain continents. You could also use different colors to make the selections stand out more and minimize the appearence of the nodes and lines that are not selected.
