#1.1
The dom in the inspector contains the generated table rows while the HTML source code does not. The DOM inspector is very helpful to see the svgs, divs, tables, etc your javascript created and make sure they were created appropriately and in the way you had intended.

#1.2
The javascript generates the table and the original data came from a json file.

#2.1
I would not since the other columns generally have unique data which would be hard to filter with

#3.1
You could aggregate them by the range their life expectancy was in like under 40 years, 40-50, 50-60, etc and you could use a slider to select the range.

#4.1
Years holds objects with the date for each year from 1995 to 2012.

#5.1
SVGs are scalable and look great at any resolution, text remains text in SVGS and does not get rendered into an image or other format are some pros, and some cons are html can be better than SVG when you are animating a huge number of items since it will be a little faster.

#7.1
Visualization is appropriate when you want to analyze a lot of data and are not just looking for a yes or no answer. A good example of when to use visualization would be to analyze health care data like average BMI, Child mortality rate, etc. of a population over a span of 10 years. Visualization will allow you to analyze the data and see the trends.

#7.2
Interactivity allows you to switch back and forth between categories and also allows you to see the growth or decline in areas since you will see them grow and shrink in real time instead of flipping between static charts.

#7.3
A limitation of visualization is that it requires human evaluation to get insight from it. This could lead to false assumptions or other errors due to human error. Also some areas of the visualization could attract our attention and make us jump to conclusions when there is something else going on that we did not notice.

#7.4
Data semantics are important because the viewer of the visualization might not be able to understand what the charts are representing or what the value the data has if the data semantics are not clear.

#7.5
Qualitative data pertains to categories such as color, which are associative and selective. Such data is hard to directly compare numerically with ideas such as greater than or less than. Whereas	quantitative data includes all numerical attributes and values that can be assigned as descriptors. Quantitative descriptors can be directly compared numerically, which adds complexity and completeness that qualitative descriptors cannot. Quantitative attributes, in most scenarios can provide more information about the relation of two attributes than qualitative

#7.6
Position, length & size, value/luminance/saturation, color, shape

#7.7
Position, length & size, value/luminance/saturation
